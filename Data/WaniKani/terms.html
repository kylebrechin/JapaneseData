    <p>Effective date: December 12, 2018</p>
    <h3 id="a-definitions">A. Definitions</h3>
    <p class="short-version"><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We use these basic terms throughout the Agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There’s not going to be a test on it, but it’s still useful information.</em></p>
    <ol>
      <li>“Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the “Terms”) and all other operating rules, policies (including the WaniKani Privacy Policy, available at <a href="privacy.html">wanikani.com/privacy</a>) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.</li>
      <li>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, audio, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. “Content” also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Your Content” is Content that you create or own.</li>
      <li>“Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Tofugu.</li>
      <li>“Tofugu,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Tofugu, LLC., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</li>
      <li>“User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See <a href="#b-account-terms">Section B.4): Additional Terms</a>).</li>
      <li>“Website” or “WaniKani” refers to Tofugu’s website located at <a href="index.html">wanikani.com</a>, and all content, Services, and products provided by Tofugu at or through the Website. It also refers to Tofugu-owned subdomains of wanikani.com, such as <a href="https://api.wanikani.com">api.wanikani.com</a>. Occasionally, Websites owned by Tofugu may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or Service.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="b-account-terms">B. Account Terms</h3>
    <p class="short-version"><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; and you must provide a valid email address. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</em></p>
    <h4 id="1-required-information">1. Required Information</h4>
    <p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a <a href="#i-payment">paid account</a>, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>
    <h4 id="2-account-requirements">2. Account Requirements</h4>
    <p>We have a few simple rules for accounts on WaniKani’s Service.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
      <li>You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young people excited to learn Japanese, we must comply with United States law. WaniKani does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will <a href="#j-cancellation-and-termination">terminate that User’s account immediately</a>. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
      <li>You may not use as a username that is a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity without appropriate authorization. You may not use a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar, or obscene.</li>
      <li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.</li>
    </ul>
